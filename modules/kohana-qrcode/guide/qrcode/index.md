QRcode provides to Kohana an easy way to generate ISO/IEC 18004:2006 quick response codes compatible with almost mobile 2-D QRcode readers

This module is based in the C libqrencode library by Kentaro Fukuchi and the QRCode class from Dominik Dzienia (see: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/phpqrcode/index.php?title=Main_Page)
