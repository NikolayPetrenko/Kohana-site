<p>
Unleashed is an easy to use iPhone application and website that is a pet network for socially engaged pet owners to improve their petâ€™s safety, well-being, and interaction with others.
</p>
<p>
	The main functionality of Unleashed is to keep your pet safe by providing the pet with an identification tag that contains a QR code that users can scan to immediately notify the pet owner of the pets location.  Users that lose their pet can send out a blast with pictures and information to other Unleashed users, export lost pet flyers, and share the emergency to Facebook and Twitter. With the up and coming technology advancements in cellular triangulation services and as the prices of this service become more affordable, a major goal is to be ready to implement the real time pet tracking ability into the application.
</p>
<p>
	The application will also act as a social network for pet owners in which users can communicate between each other, find animal related places, and check into locations.
